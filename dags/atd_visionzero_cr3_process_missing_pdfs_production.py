"""
    Description: This script will attempt to clean up invalid CR3s in the database.
    1. First, it removes the CR3 mark from temporary records.
    2. Secondly, it scans for any CR3 records that have not yet been scanned, then indexes the contents of the files.
        The indexing is basically done as follows:
        1. First the application runs file -b --mime <crash_id>.pdf file which provides the
        mime type (application/json, application/html, application/pdf, etc. And it also
        provides the encoding type: binary, us-ascii, etc. We are looking for "application/pdf"
        files with "binary" encoding.
        2. We also scan for the size of the file in local disk, smaller files (usually less
        than 5 kilobytes) are failed CR3 attempts.

        A combination of these two factors are provided to the database, and to VZE that allows
        the UI to show or hide the download button based on trivial rules:
        - If it is not binary and not an "application/json" and the size is not greater than 5kb,
        then it's not a valid PDF.
